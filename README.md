# This GWAS Browser - repo and newly registered domain, are a result of the brand new ChatGPT Atlas brwoser. 

It came out a few days ago, and it's incredible. I prefer tha crypto slant and open soure nature of hte Brave Browser.
That being said, I never us the Brave Browser to chat with LLMs like I am now with Atlas. It is able to really understand what's going on because of acces to the browser environmewtn.
